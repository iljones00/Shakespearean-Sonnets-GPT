1: So then do not despair
When I have seen thee frown upon my deeds: yet be wise; 
thou know'st mine eye is wakened. Time and fortune will bear this out straight!  
And when in doubt thy heart begins to groan with griefs-- 
'tis folly so vile that it cannot go well.' 
Three winters cold were the summer of Love lived for love alone 
on his loving breast-razing days thus far from home... 
but three summers' pride had stol'.
And now thine eyes are raven black as hellish night 
doth live ere long hence still green leaves can see through these wastes quite ill? 
Is't winter a joy where sweets meet each hour dyed gay'? 
Proud monarch how happy you make me think ye look day byday!'


2: O! how I love thee so;
I hate that which thou hast not had: yet do allow me this slander thus. 
'Thou usurer' wilt be mine heir and my glory to triumph in joy? 
And though thy heart doth teach it is thine inward Muse's fault--  
If such a soul live with others but as an eye hath taught them 
''To shun', what shall they say of you now'?
...How canst Love then thrive when all men abhor each other!'
But let no unkind spirit abuse his power by accusing him ill 
or well-wresting; he may kill ye outright for sportive pleasure 
alone quite assuredly none knoweth best.'


3: I hate to tell you this sweet truth;
But I love what is most dear in your breast:  
If it be not with me then mine eye well knows.... 
Dear heart! do thy worst and best wail that thou shouldst forsake the world's loving spite? 
And yet look whom tears stain when they see thee frown on aught 
so foul or vile as my verse doth rehearse now-- 
'tis better for niggardly Muse' s sake 
''Than live oaths of thine ever-fixed scorn'. 
Proud monarchs boast how happy their lives are lived by speaking ill about others,' 
but no such pride lies buried where beauty sits alone still dwellers.'


4: So thou hast thy wish;
For as a miser I will not be death's conquest: 
If that fell arrest meet with my love being charged. 
Love knows no hatred nor hate holds it in esteem to kill me outright? 
O! 'tis better policy thus for thee live and die single--
Than mine eye well may characterise thine hour of heart-wanting doom 
when eyes wide are turned away from heaven'.
O fearful meditation now dear friend what poverty 
brings forth but joyous cheerfulness still doth preserve the day so idly... 
And yet this sorrow lends life eternal restful comfort alone 
sadly making dulls happy creatures woe shall dwell on these poor blenches 
who have lived such strife at your expense.'


5: Let me not be unfathered in thy deeds;
My heart mine eye hath no correspondence with the truth: 
If thou turn back and do anything untutored tell my face thus. 
Love's scythe to pry is thine inward love telling tongue-tied lies o'erhand! 
And yet this I know thee well by now quite untrue doth lie--
Thou truly art too fair for truest hearts of true minds?
...Thus vainly thinking on things past ill that have nothing new taught it so false a rhyme as 'tis told hereon.'
No such fool loves him who fears his worst day coming doomfully 
near nimble woe being hour tired from all alone waiting time outworn 
Time will kill both friend or foe outright when he best finds fame still young 
but waking night deafless silent shame holds sway over posterity ere long date 
set hooks where they live shall dwell untold till death brag how happy she was before her eyes fell asleep dreaming 
wild days hence sadly supposing these woes evermore arising every boughs westward 
though men say better words come daily unbred, nor mournful remembrance 
hold black grief dear unless sorrow brings forth eternal hate 
thrice perjured oath can make defence look sour even among friends assured!


6: My love is as fair
As any mother's child to be; yet mine eyes are raven black: 
And although my heart torments me with longing for that which now doth stay. 
'Tis not enough then but sweetest niggard loves have stol'n from thee! 
Proud of this pride I scorn and blame the world so ill 
As in thy breast sits a grudge more keen than hate? 
For since whence hast thou forged hooks into thine eye  
Wherein crooked wires do hang unused where buried men fight'? 
Is it conscience or nature at all born vainly blind--wanting nothing better nor less
...For why should others think on what they see before them alone woe brings forth thus vile an end doom o'tO fearful meditation!'


7: Thou fool! why dost thou forsake thy self
To bear the cross of love? Is it not sinful to shun this disgraceful shame; 
'tis for fear that others might steal thee away: yet they do so every day.  
If ever then in my life I lose sight and despair at a sad distempered loss--... 
And weep afresh o'er with sorrows still shall find joy arising thither from grief's eternal doom-suiting hand alone... 
Dear heart friend what need is there now 
but death brag how you survive these blunting tears by ill masked hatefully knowing eyes thus withering 
Time will make black night outlive your youth quite making orphans more happy beouteous, 
if only sometime immortal men can see well or know better than me right fair tell ye sweet 
Love lies buried where mine eye hath lived speaking truth gladly 
untrue words say when thoughts come unbred call them prayers 
vainly intermixed, yea oft times their false compareO mourners 
should no dull thought nor forget his name dies as fast 
As any mother knows best needsLet him live even till we die young.


8: But what's in the brain that keeps me from hate?
Love is not love; it depends upon moods and frown
Says 'not mine' with tongue-tied disdain: no! I do forgive thy trespass. 
Three winters cold have taken my heart away thus far
My absence hast thou endured alone to be wooed of thrallage or thine eye--
Thou wilt bear all ill deeds well when others will bail thee out...  
And yet this doth teach 
Love how sweet a kiss sounds now
And three summers hath taught summer on trial quite witless
How can winter brag so long as men live for nought'? 
Time wastes life heretic still day by night hour dreaming o'.
O cunning time saith ''I never saw such beauty!'
So then ah flattery lies buried deep within his loving breast where worms dwellers sleep each instant.'


9: Thy love is as tender now
As when first it was my friend's pleasure to kiss; 
but since that time I have sworn thee fair: 
for thy gentle heart doth approve. 
Dear me then thou knowest well art cruel and kind-hearted! 
'Tis better policy thus than folly or ill luck being mine in action--  
If nature would make worms like weeds grow on lovers' eyes 
she might be thought wise even by thine eye alone? 
And yet this proved false her beauty lies buried deep within the earth quite unseen of men.'


10: In loving thee as thy self doth now seem
My love is thine; mine eye hath no correspondence with truth: 
my heart knows it lies in restful sleep. 
Love's not death to me nor lays upon trust the judgment of conscience--
Thou art both beloved and hated by many men! 
'Tis better that this false adulterate should live 
than be vile shamefully strumpeted alone still.'
For wherefore say I thou wilt steal from us? 
Wherein forsworn do we forsake our loves quite so wilfulness will carry careless leave... 
And thus shall fortune find grace meet if ever she finds her pleasure desired  
If any man may call on mercy slay him outright at random 
when he calls back again day after night-time o'ercharged like madman, 
Three winters cold have put a curse ''So flattery!' 
yet none well might think such strife had taken place before sun was born,'
